# [  C O R P S E  |  P I L O T  ]

A text based terminal game.

Requires Python 3 and the NumPy module.

To check whether Python 3 is installed on your device, run:

    python3 --version

if a version is returned, then it is installed.

Otherwise, it can be installed via:

* Package manager on Linux

        apt install python3

* Microsoft Store on Windows

* Official distribution

        [python.org](https://python.org)

Do the same with Pip, a package manager for Python modules.
Your installation of Python may already include Pip.

    pip --version

Once both are installed, navigate to the root directory, then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install dependencies.

To play, from root directory, execute:

    python3 corpse_pilot_prototype.py

Enjoy.
