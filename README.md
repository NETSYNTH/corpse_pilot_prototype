# corpse_pilot_prototype

A text based terminal game.

Requires Python 3 and the NumPy module.

To check whether Python 3 is installed on your device, run:

  python3 --version

if a version is returned, then it is installed.
Otherwise, use your OS package manager to install it.

Do the same with Pip, a package manager for Python modules.

  pip --version

Once both are installed, navigate to the root directory:

  ~/corpse_pilot_prototype/

then run:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

From root directory, you can run:

  python3 corpse_pilot_prototype.py

Enjoy.
